Convex Hull Builder

Purpose: In this assignment, you are asked to develop a Java program which computes the convex hull or convex envelope of N points using Graham’s scan algorithm. The convex hull of N points is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of it. It finds the minimum area convex region that contains every point. 
The Graham’s algorithm depends on the two important properties of a convex hull:
    • Can traverse the convex hull by making only counterclockwise turns
    • The vertices of convex hull appear in increasing order of polar angle with respect to point p with lowest y-coordinate.
